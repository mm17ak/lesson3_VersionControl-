## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
In lesson 3, we learned about version control systems (VCS). More specifically what a VCS, what it does, and how it benefits us as developers. We also learned about the two types of VCS, remote and local repository. Lastly we learned about GIT, a local repository type of VCS that we are going to be using in this course.
