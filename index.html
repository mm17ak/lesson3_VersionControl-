            <p class="lead">Is a software that functions as one main repository while storing all files and their revisions that are associated with a project. The purpose of version control is to solve file sharing and editing problems. Often times, when revisions are conducted on files they are saved under a new naming convention. While saving revisions under new naming conventions may seem feasible at first, it will get out of control the more files the user stores.  Version control is useful when working on a project in groups. It allows members to check the file out from the version control, make changes to it, and return the file to the version control once they are done. Doing this, eliminates team members overriding each other’s work.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system VCS, sometimes referred to as a revision control system, a version control feature that allows users to share files and avoid some of the issues that are associated with file sharing. An example of the VCS is when students are working on a document via a Google Doc. The version control will inform group members which team member modified the file, when it was modified, changes that were made to the file, and if files were merged in the process. A VCS informs team members what is being to the file and by whom, providing them with more independence when collaborating on projects. VCS does not allow files to be overwritten, but it does allow for members to revert back to older versions if need be.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS are classified into two categories, Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS. Centralized, sometimes referred to as remote, keeps all of the history changes on a centralized server. Meaning that everyone who has access to the server, will have access to the files and its changes. Examples of centralized VCS include Subversion, CVS, and Perforce. A distributed VCS, often times referred to a  local repository, stores all of the file changes on a local machine. A benefit to this is that users do not have to be online in order to access the content. Examples of a distributed VCS are GIT and Mercurial.</p>

            <p class="lead">A free and open source VCS for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work with multiple groups of people. GIT is a popular platform that is used by many individual users and major corporations such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Netflix. As a distributed VCS, GIT stores everything locally so its users can work online and the processes turn to run faster to the benefits of being distributed. GIT has many commands available in order manipulate the repository. The main three commands used in GIT are Add, Commit, and Push. Thanks to GIT, nothing is ever final we can always retrace our steps when modifying files. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In today’s information society, there is an ample amount of languages to learn in order to be a successful developer. None are more important than GIT, a distributed version control system. GIT allows end users to track changes to their files over time and in doing so it simplifies working in groups. As a GIT user, developers will have access to their workload from virtually anywhere. In addition, they will track every version of their code over time which makes it easy to backpedal your changes. Tracking these changes allows to revert back to previous projects and improve upon them. Lastly, it’s a great way to share your work with others.</p>
